Description: The Correlation Matrices that arise in financial markets appear to
    have some special properties, which makes it a little bit challenging to be
    able to generate them artificially in a way that hold all of these 
    properties. Some statistical methods have been proposed. In this package we
    have implemented some of the methods. We also implemented a few methods for
    verifying the properties.
